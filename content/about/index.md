Hey — I’m Harikrishna S., currently studying Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Hyderabad.

I enjoy programming for fun, going to the gym, and getting lost in a good book. Most of the time, I’m either building something random, trying to understand how low-level systems work, or reading up on the latest in AI and automation. I'm the kind of person who likes knowing how things really work — not just at the surface level, but under the hood.

This blog is where I share what I learn, build, and think about. It could be a small project, a deep dive into a tech topic, or just thoughts on something I found interesting. I started this mainly to keep track of my own progress — but if someone else finds it useful, that’s even better.

I'm also getting into startups and figuring out how to turn ideas into something real — so expect posts on that too.

Thanks for stopping by.
